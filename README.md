# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, the application main features are:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category.
2) Delete questions. 
3) Add questions. 
4) Search for questions based on a search term. 
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
